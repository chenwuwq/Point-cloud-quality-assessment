# Basic FR-PCQA
Basic full-reference quality assessment metrics implemented by python.

I try to implement the p2point, p2plane, and PSNR_yuv with python.
The original algoritms come from "Evaluation criteria for PCC (Point Cloud Compression)","Dynamic Polygon Clouds: Representation and Compression for VR/AR", and "Geometric Distortion Metrics for Point Cloud Compression".
