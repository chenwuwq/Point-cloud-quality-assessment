# Full-reference-point-cloud-evaluation
Basic full-reference quality assessment metrics implemented by python.

I try to implement the p2point, p2plane, and PSNR_yuv with python.
The original algoritms come from `Evaluation criteria for PCC (Point Cloud Compression)',`Dynamic Polygon Clouds: Representation and Compression for VR/AR', and 'Geometric Distortion Metrics for Point Cloud Compression'.
